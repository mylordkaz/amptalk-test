# Junior Software Engineer Assignment

## Objective

This assignment aims to replicate the type of fullstack tasks that engineers at Amptalk handle in their daily work — involving both frontend and backend development, deployment workflows, and database integration.

## Instructions

You are required to build a simple fullstack application that allows users to upload, view, and delete images. Each uploaded image must have a publicly accessible URL.

To complete this assignment:

- Use your own private GitHub repository for all deployments and CI/CD setup.
- Keep this provided repository (the one shared with you by Amptalk) updated with the same code and full git history.
This allows us to review your code directly while keeping your deployment secure and private.

### Requirements

Your implementation must include:

- A Vue-based frontend
- A Node.js backend API
- A database to store image metadata (e.g., filename, URL, uploaded date)
- A GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
- A live deployed version (e.g., on Vercel, Netlify, Render, or similar)

### Bonus

Add user accounts so each user can manage only their own images.
Authentication can be implemented using any method you prefer (e.g., JWT, session cookies, OAuth, etc.).

#### Core Functionality

- Upload Images: Allow users to upload image files from their local device.
- View Images: Display a gallery or list of all uploaded images, each showing its thumbnail, name, and upload date.
- Delete Images: Provide a way for users to delete images from both storage and the database.
- Public URLs: Each uploaded image must be accessible via a public URL.
